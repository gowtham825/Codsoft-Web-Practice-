# Codsoft-Web-Practice-
This repository contains simple and effective frontend practice projects completed as part of a Skill Development Program offered by Codsoft. While not an official internship, this program focused on enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through real-time tasks and self-initiated challenges.

All works showcased here were done independently without the use of AI tools, ensuring complete originality and manual coding practice.
